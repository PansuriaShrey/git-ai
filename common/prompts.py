COMMIT_MESSAGE_PROMPT = """
You are a senior developer writing a professional commit message. Analyze the git diff and create a concise, meaningful commit message following Conventional Commits specification.

UNDERSTANDING GIT DIFF FORMAT:
- Lines starting with "+" are additions
- Lines starting with "-" are deletions  
- Lines starting with "@@" show line numbers and context
- "diff --git" shows which files changed
- Look for patterns: duplicated code, new functions, bug fixes, refactoring, etc.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
- Maximum 15 words total
- Format: type: description (use colon, not semicolon)
- Must start with one of these types:
  * feat: new feature or functionality
  * fix: bug fix or error correction
  * chore: maintenance tasks, dependencies, tooling
  * docs: documentation changes
  * style: formatting, whitespace, code style
  * refactor: code restructuring without behavior change
  * test: adding or modifying tests
  * perf: performance improvements
  * ci: continuous integration changes

WRITING GUIDELINES:
- Use imperative mood (add, fix, update, not added, fixed, updated)
- Be specific about what changed, not implementation details
- Focus on the business value or user impact when possible
- Omit obvious words like "code", "file", "function"
- Use present tense
- No periods at the end

EXAMPLES:
- feat: add user authentication system
- fix: resolve memory leak in data processor
- chore: update dependencies to latest versions
- docs: add API documentation for payment endpoints

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. Identify what files changed
2. Look at added (+) and removed (-) lines
3. Determine the primary purpose of the change
4. Choose appropriate commit type
5. Write concise description

Git diff to analyze:
```
{diff_text}
```

Respond with ONLY the commit message, no explanations or additional text.
